# Yuconz
Annual review system for yuconz Directors, Managers and Employees. 

Software Engineering project where we practiced agile development, following use cases and communicating with the client
to get the correct specification

Main functions needed were:
Logging in and out
Autorisation and authentication checks and logging of actions
Reading, editing and creating personal details with restrictions to who can do it
Reading, editing and creating anual reviews with similar restrictions
Allocating reviewers to specific reviews (Primary and Secondary)
Adding objectives to reviews and allow future reviews to see those objectives
